Website: the app file in the Website folder, copy the website link in the last line and paste in a new page.
The link go to the First page of website. It provide the information about wind mill and predicting energy output.
Click the "want to predcit energy" box
Then choose the city for weather Information.
Then type the theoretical power and speed in the box.
It will predict the energy output.
